## ChatGPT Prompt 🤖

> Generate the boilerplate for a Node.js Express.js server integrated with the OpenAI API. The server includes morgan as a logging middleware, serves static files, and exposes a JSON API for text completion. The project uses vanilla HTML, JavaScript, and Tailwind CSS, with scripts for development and production in package.json. The front-end includes a form to submit prompts to the API, and the server's responses are displayed on the page. The project uses a public directory for static files and dotenv for environment variables. Also, remember to include a README with detailed instructions
